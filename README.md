# Flutter-Node.js Express Project

This project is a demonstration of building a full-stack application using Flutter for the frontend and Node.js Express for the backend. The Flutter app communicates with the backend server to perform various tasks such as fetching data, submitting forms, and more.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- Data fetching: The Flutter app fetches data from the Node.js Express server using HTTP requests.
- CRUD operations: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources stored on the server.
- Real-time updates: Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or any suitable technology.
- Scalability: Designed to be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent users and requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Node.js Express
- **Database:** (Mention your choice of database, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Communication:** RESTful API (for HTTP communication between Flutter and Express)
- **Deployment:** (Mention your deployment strategy, e.g., Docker, AWS, Heroku)
